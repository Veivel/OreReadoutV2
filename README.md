# Ore Readout V2

> **TLDR: Customizable ore readouts for server console and staff!**

A simple Fabric mod to notify staff and server console when certain blocks (e.g. ores) are broken.
If you are familiar with OreAnnouncer and OreNotifier, 
this is basically the lite version of those but on Fabric.

This mod comes in handy as a server administrator 
when you want to catch potential xrayers and cheaters,
but prefer not using an anti-xray or ore obfuscator mod.

## Configuration

When you load the mod for the first time, a `config/ore-readout.yml` file should be generated.

```yml
readoutTargets:
  # send to server console
  console: true
  # send to discord via webhook
  discord: false
  # send to in-game chat (requires permissions set up)
  ingame: true

# webhook URL for discord readouts
discordWebhookUrl: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/xxx

# blocks to notify for. you can add or remove blocks as you wish
blocks:
- diamond_ore
- deepslate_emerald_ore
- ancient_debris
```

## Permissions

#### Base Permissions

Any permissions manager that uses `fabric-permissions-api` is (at least in theory) supported 
â€“ e.g. LuckPerms, CyberPermissions, Universal Perms. This mod was tested only with LuckPerms.

If you have `readoutTargets.ingame=true` in the config, you will need to make sure
your staff have the permission `ore-readout.view` enabled.

If you configured it properly, your staff should see:

#### Toggle your own Notifications

With the permissions `ore-readout.root` and `ore-readout.toggle` enabled, you can temporarily disable ore readouts
in your own chat (as staff) with the command `/ore toggle`. 
This setting is temporary and will be reset after the server is stopped or restarted.

#### Teleporting

You can also click on the coordinates to automatically type out `/tp {x} {y} {z}` to more easily teleport to the scene. Hovering over it will say "Click here to teleport to the location".

## Support

I only picked up development of this Fabric mod after finding [the original version](https://modrinth.com/mod/ore-readout) by yitzy299, which was abandoned four years ago. While you may ask for support or make feature requests on our GitHub issues tracker, **I cannot make promises to deliver anything**.

If there is a change you want made, consider contributing!
